Hi! I'm Quin, a sophomore at Cornell majoring in Computer Science with a minor
in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am a part-time backend developer for
a food delivery startup, and an Electrical Subteam member of CUAir. I have been
involved in various end-user application projects, but I am focused on exploring
my interests in computer systems (databases, operating systems, embedded systems,
distributed systems, security). I also love cooking and being outside in nature.
